=> Data Structe is a way of storing and organizing data in memory efficiently.

=> It is a way of managing, retriving, inserting, deleting data efficiently

=> mainly 2 types of data Structure
    => Primitive data structure
    => Non Primitive data structure
        => Linear data structure e.g. Arrays, Linked list, Stacks, and Queues
        => Non-linear data structure :: When one element is connected to the 'n' number of elements eg, TREE, GRAPHS

=> Data structures can also be classified as:
    => Static data structure: It is a type of data structure where the size is allocated at the compile time. Therefore, the maximum size is fixed.
    => Dynamic data structure: It is a type of data structure where the size is allocated at the run time. Therefore, the maximum size is flexible.

=> Major Operations
The major or the common operations that can be performed on the data structures are:
    => Searching: We can search for any element in a data structure.
    => Sorting: We can sort the elements of a data structure either in an ascending or descending order.
    => Insertion: We can also insert the new element in a data structure.
    => Updation: We can also update the element, i.e., we can replace the element with another element.
    => Deletion: We can also perform the delete operation to remove the element from the data structure.

=> Advantages of Data structures
    => Efficiency
    => Reusability
    => Abstraction
