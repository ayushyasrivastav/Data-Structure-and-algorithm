=>In selection sort, we select the minimun value and swap it with the minimum index of unsorted array


=> STEP 1: input the array from user
=> STEP 2: start a loop from 0 to N-1 (i)
=> STEP 3: setting the lowest index as min
=> STEP 4: start the nested loop {j}
=> STEP 5: array[min] > array[j]  min = j
=> STEP 6: end of nested loop
=> STEP 7: swap the min index with index i
=> STEP 8: end of iteration loop
=> STEP 9: return value to the user
