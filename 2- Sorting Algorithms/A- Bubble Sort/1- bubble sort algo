=> Bubble sort is algorithm which comapres the adjecent elements and swap the elements if they are not in intended order.
     Order can be ascending or descnding

=> ALGO:

Step 1: Repeat Step 2 For i = 0 to N-1
Step 2: Repeat For J = i + 1 to N - I
Step 3: IF A[J] > A[i]
SWAP A[J] and A[i]
[END OF INNER LOOP]
[END OF OUTER LOOP
Step 4: EXIT


=>Time Complexity:
     => Worst case complexity: O(n^2) {simply observing there are 2 loops}
     => Best case complexity: O(n)
     => Average case complexity: O(n^2)

=> Space Complexity:
     => for bubble sort O(1) {using one varible for swapping}
     => for optimized bubble sort O(2) {using two varibles one for swapping and another for breaking the loop}
