=> Bubble sort is algorithm which comapres the adjecent elements and swap the elements if they are not in intended order.
     Order can be ascending or descnding

=> ALGO:

Step 1: Repeat Step 2 For i = 0 to N-1
Step 2: Repeat For J = i + 1 to N - I
Step 3: IF A[J] > A[i]
SWAP A[J] and A[i]

[END OF OUTER LOOP
Step 4: EXIT
