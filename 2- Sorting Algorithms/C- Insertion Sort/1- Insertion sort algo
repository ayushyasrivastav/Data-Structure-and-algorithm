=>In selection sort, we select the minimun value and swap it with the minimum index of unsorted array


=> STEP 1: Input the array
=> STEP 2: asume that the 1st element of the array is sorted
=> STEP 3: start the iteration loop from i=1 to n
=> STEP 4: take the arr[i] element as key
=> STEP 5: j = i -1
=> STEP 6: while key < arr[j] and j >= 0
=> STEP 7: move element arr[j] to the right by 1
=> STEP 8: decrese j by 1
=> STEP 9: End of while loop
=> STEP 10: insert the key at position j+1
=> STEP 11: End of iteration loop
=> STEP 12: return the sorted array


=>Time Complexity:
     => Worst case complexity: O(n^2) {simply observing there are 2 loops}
     => Best case complexity: O(n)
     => Average case complexity: O(n^2)

=> Space Complexity:
     => for bubble sort O(1) {using one varible for key store}
